        <h2>Hamburger</h2>
        <h6>Posted on January 1, 1900</h6>
        
        <p id="1">The hamburger has just been invented! Most of you might not know what a hamburger is, but I can tell you it is delicious. A hamburger is a cooked patty of ground beef, put inside between two buns with toppings of your choice. Hamburgers are amazing. One bite will get you hooked on them. Although they are delicious, they aren't very healthy. Only have hamburgers once in a while as a treat.</p>

        <p id="2">God has given us a gift! Not in the form of a human, but in the form of a food. God has blessed us with pizza! Made in the shape of a circle, and eaten in the shape of a triangle, the pizza is a 3 layered food. The first layer is crust, the second is tomato sauce, and the third is cheese. You can also add toppings like pepperoni or bacon. Pizza is like a taste of heaven!</p>
